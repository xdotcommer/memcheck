Memcheck
========

Rails plugin to help with tracking down memory leaks, with a few caveats.
 * this plugin will only work with *nix type operating systems as it relies on the output of "ps"
 * this plugin runs garbage collection after every controller action, so it is only intended for diagnostic purposes
